\section{Abstract}
In this experiment we studied the effects of increasing the cross-sectional area of a cart on its acceleration and velocity.
Through this, we proved that air resistance exists and is directly correlated to the cross-sectional area of an object, as well as its shape. Furthermore, we found that air resistance can be decreased by keeping cross-sectional area constant and changing the shape of an object.

\section{Introduction}

Throughout high school physics, we have been calculating the range of projectiles, the velocity of carts, and even the acceleration of planes - all by assuming that air resistance is negligible.
In this experiment, we set out to prove that air resistance does exist, and that it has a significant impact on acceleration and velocity of an object relative to its cross-sectional area
