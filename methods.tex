%\section{Methods}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A 250g weight was taped onto the Smart Cart to make the effect of additional weight negligible
    \item A 1.22m ramp was placed on top of a textbook so that it made a 3.19 degree angle with the lab bench counter
    \item Depending on the trial being run, a cardboard attachment was measured and cut to proper dimensions and taped to the front of the Smart Car
    \item The Smart Car's position, velocity, force, and acceleration were all recorded relative to time using Pasco Capstone software
    \item Steps 3 and 4 were repeated eight more times until all trial data were successfully collected
\end{enumerate}
